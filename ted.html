<h1>Ted</h1>
<p>This is a great example of successful interactive design. The first thing that I noticed is that the videos are laid out in front of you in a clean manor. The bold typeface over each video gives you a very quick to the point over view of what the video is about. When you hover over the video more information is revealed and it animates the bounding box! Even when you scroll down the text in the videos rearranges to make the title most visible according to your scroll posistion. Clean, responsive, clear, and to the point!</p>
