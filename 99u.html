<p>This site has a really clean designer layout. The type thats used looks strong but not overly so. I enjoy having a news feed that is simple and linear in an up and down style. This makes things less distracted. They still have other stories on the side but they have no visuals which makes it easier to focus on the new content on the left. A bonus is the easy navigation at any time. The navigation bar follows you as you scroll down, which gives you a feeling of control. I could imagine having a more exciting roll over with story images. I love how the community can comment on stories and interact.</p>
