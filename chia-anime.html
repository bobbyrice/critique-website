<h1>Chia-Anime</h1>
<p>This site is just completely cluttered with ads and pop ups! It makes the user experience quite annoying at each click. When selecting the first letter of a show the organization is OK with the picture. But the main thing people are looking at is the title of the show. The titles type face is to similar in size and style to that of the body text to differentiate.  Also some of the information in tables is cut off from running to long! The whole website feels very cluttered. There is a lot of information and shows, but it could be organized a lot better.</p>
