<h1>Canon Rumors</h1>
<p><h2>This site is a small example of bad user interaction. The main things that bugs me about the site is how the ads are embedded with the navigation bar which clutters the layout on top and the side. The icons for social media at top looks really cheesy in full color in contrast to the black and red “canon theme” they have going on. The news feed is not seamless, you have to click next page every 10 stories or so. This can become really frustrating if you want to look through some of their older content. I enjoy how the author tags and links hash tags and stories to other similar stories so if you want to read more about that specific topic, it's all available in one click.</h2></p>
